# ExTABER

## Introduction
ExTABER is a platform where independent investigative journalists can publish their work, create a readership, and 
potentially monetise their work. The ethos underlying ExTABER is hidden in form of an anagram in its name. The 
anagram is based on the epistemological viewpoint that free thought must exist **Ex** Tradition, **A**authority, 
**E**established **B**relief, and **R**evelation.
